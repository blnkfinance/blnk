## Open-source fintech ledger for the internet

Blnk Ledger is an open-source fintech database for building fintech products to standard and at scale. We designed Blnk to help developers do three things well:

1. Accurately record transactions in their system.
2. Correctly manage complex flow of funds and transaction data.
3. Reliably manage the size of your transactions as your product scales.

## About Blnk

Building fintech starts off simple, and gets quickly difficult & complex the more time you spend with it. Blnk offers specialized tools to help developers today manage and navigate this complexity correctly for their respective organizations.

Every fintech product is made up of transactions â€” happening concurrently, moving all the time from one place to another. Sometimes, they will interact with parties outside of your application like cards, deposits, bank accounts, etc; sometimes, they happen within your application between user balances or to/fro your organization accounts.

With Blnk, you get a full-service starting point for building, managing and operating money movement and store of value in a reliable, secure and scaleable way.
